# todolist

My first JavaScript focused website. 
I didn't know at the time but it turns out it's one of the most common projects chosen by beginners to built. Nevertheless, it was a stepping stone for me, as a beginner, to build it without following a tutorial.

Functionalities go like this:

- if you click "Submit" without having a task written in the box, an error message will appear in red saying "Add a task first";
- write a task into the appropiate box, then click Submit and the tasks will be added with a coresponding chronological number in front of the text;
- after each task two buttons will appear: an "X" - button which will erase that specific task and a "Done" - button which will apply a strikethrough line to that specific task letting the user know that it's a completed task. Also, when the task is deleted the chronological numbers of the tasks update automatically;
- finally, the "Clear list" button erases all the tasks.
