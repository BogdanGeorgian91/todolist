It's my second completed project and I've focused on JavaScript functionality. Deployed on 7th of September 2021.
I didn't know at the time but it turns out it's one of the most common projects chosen by beginners to built. Nevertheless, it was a stepping stone for me, as a beginner, to build it without following a tutorial.

Video of the user flow:

Functionalities go like this:

- if you click "Submit" without having a task written in the box, an error message will appear in red saying "Add a task first";
- write a task into the appropiate box, then click "Submit" and the task (text) will be added below with a coresponding chronological number in front of the text;
- after each task, two buttons will appear: an "X" - button which will erase that specific task and a "Done" - button which will apply a strikethrough line to that specific task letting the user know that it's a completed task. Also, when the task is deleted the chronological numbers of the tasks update automatically;
- finally, the "Clear list" button erases all the tasks.
